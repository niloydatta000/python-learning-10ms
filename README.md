# Python Learning Repository 📘🐍

This repository contains the Python files I created while learning Python through the **10 Minute School** course mentored by **Niamul Hasan**.

> **Note:** These files are not direct copies of what was taught. I customized them significantly to better understand the concepts and apply my own logic during the learning process.

## 📁 What's Inside

- Python scripts covering major topics like:
  - Variables & data types
  - Loops & conditionals
  - Functions
  - File handling
  - Modules & packages
  - Basic external libraries
  - Introduction of Object Oriented Programming
- A `requirements.txt` file for installing any external libraries used.
- Comments throughout the code to explain:
  - Correct Python syntax
  - Common beginner mistakes
  - Why something is done a certain way (especially when it wasn’t obvious at first)

⚠️ The comments are **informal and beginner-friendly** — meant for learning, not production code.
